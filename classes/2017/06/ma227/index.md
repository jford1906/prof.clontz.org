## Course Description

This course expands upon the concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals
introduced in Calculus 1 and 2.
Students will investigate **vectors** and the geometry of
**n-dimensional Euclidean space**, including
**vector functions** and **functions of several variables** and various
notions of limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration defined
for such functions.
The ultimate goal of the course is
to be able to recognize and use various forms of the
**fundamental theorem of calculus** as they appear throughout vector
calculus.


## Textbook and Resources

Lecture notes and suggested homework
for this course will be available at no cost at
[prof.clontz.org/resources/calculus-3][text]. Students are welcome to use
*University Calculus: Early Transcendentals (3rd Ed)* or any other textbook
as a supplemental resource, but it is not required.


## Mastering Standards

The main goal of this course is for students to **master** the
**Core and Supplemental Standards** for the course.
A list of these standards is available on the
[Standards page][standards].

Course lectures will be dedicated to covering each standard and working
examples. After each standard has been covered, it will be assessed on
several **Mastery Quizzes** at the beginning of subsequent classes.
Mastery of standards will also be assessed on the **Midterm Exam**
and **Final Exam**.

Each exercise will be marked by the instructor as follows.

* **✓**: The response demonstrates complete understanding of the Standard.
* **★**: The response may indicate complete understanding of the Standard,
  but clarification or minor corrections are required.
* **×**: The response does not demonstrate complete understanding of the
  Standard.

Students may improve **★** marks to **✓** marks on quizzes or the midterm
by correctly reworking the exercise on paper and submitting this new attempt
to the instructor on the weekday following the date the marked
exercise is returned. On the Final Exam, exercises may not be reworked, but
up to four **★** marks will be automatically converted to **✓** marks.




## Grade Assignments

Grades are assigned based on students' mastery of the Core and Supplemental
Standards. This is calculated by adding up to **2** earned **✓** marks for each
of the twelve Core Standards,
and up to **1** earned **✓** mark for each of the twelve
Supplemental Standards, for a total of **36** possible **✓** marks.

* **A**:
    * At least **34/36** **✓** marks have been earned.
    * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **12/12** Core Standards.
* **B**:
    * At least **28/36** **✓** marks have been earned.
    * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **10/12** Core Standards.
* **C**:
    * At least **22/36** **✓** marks have been earned.
    * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **8/12** Core Standards.
* **D**:
    * At least **18/36** **✓** marks have been earned.





## Student Data

Student data will be stored on the instructor's office computer, and will
be available via printed progress reports distributed during class at
regular intervals.


## Academic Honesty

Any violations of academic honesty will be reported to the University
and will result in **automatic and immediate failure of the course**. Refer to
South's [Additional Academic Course Policies][usacoursepolicies] for
