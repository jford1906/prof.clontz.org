## S02. The Dot Product

- The dot product \\(\vect v\cdot\vect w\\)
  measures the work done by a force
  given by \\(\vect v\\) along a displacement given by \\(\vect w\\).
    - If the force is in the same direction of the displacement, then work
      is simply given by scalar multiplication of the magnitudes of
      \\(\vect v,\vect w\\).
    - If the force is orthogonal to displacement, then no work is done.
    - It may be computed by
      \\(\vect v\cdot\vect w=\\|\vect v\\|\\|\vect w\\|\cos\theta\\) where
      \\(\theta\\) is the angle between the vectors.
- The following properties may be proven about the dot product.
    - \\(\vect{v} \cdot \vect{w} = \vect{w}\cdot\vect{v}\\)
    - \\((c\vect{v})\cdot \vect{w} = \vect{v} \cdot (c\vect{w}) = c(\vect{v} \cdot \vect{w})\\)
    - \\(\vect{v} \cdot (\vect{w}_1 + \vect{w}_2) = \vect{v}\cdot\vect{w}_1 + \vect{v}\cdot \vect{w}_2\\)
    - \\(\vect{v} \cdot \vect{v} = \\|\vect{v}\\|^2\\)
    - \\(\vect{0} \cdot \vect{v} = 0\\)
- These properties may be used to obtain a simplified formula:
  \\(\vect v\cdot\vect w=v_xw_x+v_yw_y+v_zw_z\\).
    - This allows \\(\theta\\) be easily computed from
      \\(\cos\theta=\frac{\vect v\cdot\vect w}{\\|\vect v\\|\\|\vect w\\|}\\).
    - Thus two nonzero vectors are orthogonal if and only if
      \\(\vect v\cdot\vect w=0\\).
