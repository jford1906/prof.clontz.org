## Course Description

This course expands upon the concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals
introduced in Calculus 1. In addition to developing **advanced
integration techniques** and covering several **applications of integrals**,
the ultimate goal of the course is
to introduce the **power series**, a polynomial with infinitely-many
terms that can be used to characterize a wide class of differentiable
functions.

This course utilizes **team-based learning**.
Students will
complete a survey that will place them into appropriate Teams at the
start of the semester, and are expected to complete readiness activities
before coming to class.
Teams will work together throughout the semester to master course
standards, with the support of the instructor.


## Textbook and Resources

All material for this course is available at no cost at
[prof.clontz.org/resources/calculus-2][text]. Students are welcome to use
*University Calculus: Early Transcendentals (3rd Ed)* or any other textbook
as a supplemental resource, but it is not required.

Students may be asked to provide dry-erase markers for use during class.

It's not required, but many students benefit from bringing a smart device
to class.


## Standards

The main goal of this course is for students to **master** the
**Core and Supporting Standards** for the course by earning
**✓** marks for each standard throughout the semester.
A list of these standards is available on the
[Standards page][standards].




## Grade Assignments

Grades are assigned based on students' mastery of the Core and Supporting
Standards. This is calculated by adding up to **2** earned **✓** marks
for each of the sixteen Core Standards,
and up to **1** earned **✓** mark for each of the sixteen
Supporting Standards, for a total of **48** possible **✓** marks.

* **A**:
  * At least **46/48** **✓** marks have been earned.
  * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **16/16** Core Standards.
* **B**:
  * At least **38/48** **✓** marks have been earned.
  * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **14/16** Core Standards.
* **C**:
  * At least **30/48** **✓** marks have been earned.
  * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **12/16** Core Standards.
* **D**:
  * At least **24/48** **✓** marks have been earned.


## Team Formation

**Teams** of 4-6 students will be formed based upon a survey
of students' academic interests and abilities.
Members of each Team will collaborate on quizzes and activities
throughout the semester.


## Participation

### Preparation for Class

The [class calendar][calendar] outlines the
sections of [online materials][text] that students will be
responsible for reviewing in preparation for class each week.

### Quizzes

On the first day of class each week, students will first be given an
**Individual Readiness Quiz (IRQ)** of multiple-choice
questions to check their understanding of the online materials.

Immediately following the IRQ (before solutions are revealed),
each Team will come together to take an
identical **Team Readiness Quiz (TRQ)**, discussing each member's choices and
agreeing on a solution. These responses are immediately revealed as correct
or incorrect, and the Team will keep guessing until the correct answer is
found.

### Activities

On days without an IRQ/TRQ, the instructor will assign **Activities**
to be completed as a Team during the last 60 minutes of class.

### Attempt Points

Each week, the instructor will award **Attempt Points (AP)** to each student
based on a qualitative assessment of that student's participation during
the previous week. If necessary,
the instructor will solicit survey feedback
from the class to make that determination quantitatively instead;
if so, participation on the survey will be required to earn that week's AP.



## Attempting Standards

Students may spend their Attempt Points to individually demonstrate mastery
of the Core and Supporting Standards.

* During the first 15 minutes of days without an IRQ/TRQ, students are given
  a **Mastery Quiz** containing several
  **In-Class Exercises** based on several of the most recently covered
  Standards.
  Each submitted In-Class Exercise costs 1AP; exercises that are not submitted
  do not cost AP.
* Each day during office hours, students may attempt up to two
  **Office Exercises** based on
  any Standard covered so far during the course. Each attempt costs 2AP
  (whether or not it is completed successfully) plus the following:
    * +2AP on a second daily attempt.
    * +1AP for each week past the Standard's [deadline][standards].
* The **Final Exam** will contain several **Final Exercises**: two for each Core
  Standard, and one for each Supporting Standard.
  Students may submit their attempts for up to 16 different exercises.
  These final attempts do not cost any AP, but time is limited.

Each exercise is marked by the instructor as follows.

* **✓**: The response demonstrates complete understanding of the Standard.
* **★**: The response may indicate complete understanding of the Standard,
  but clarification or minor corrections are required.
* **×**: The response does not demonstrate complete understanding of the
  Standard.

Students may improve **★** marks to **✓** marks as follows.

* For In-Class Exercises, the solution must be correctly reworked and
  submitted to the instructor on the weekday following the date the marked
  exercise is returned. (This does not cost any AP.)
* For Office Exercises, **★** marks are not offered (the instructor will
  request any necessary clarification or minor corrections during the attempt).
* For Final Exercises, **★** marks are automatically converted to **✓** marks
  at a cost of 10AP per each conversion.





## Student Data

Student data will be stored on the instructor's office computer, and will
be available via printed progress reports distributed during class at
regular intervals.


## Academic Honesty

Any violations of academic honesty will be reported to the University
and will result in **automatic and immediate failure of the course**. Refer to
South's [Additional Academic Course Policies][usacoursepolicies] for
more information.
