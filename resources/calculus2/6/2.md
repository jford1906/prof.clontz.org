- Let \\(f(x)\\) have derivatives of all orders nearby \\(a\\). Then the
  Taylor series generated by \\(f\\) at \\(a\\) is given by
  \\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k\\),
  where \\(f^{(k)}(a)\\) is the \\(k^{th}\\) derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(a\\).
- A Maclaurin series is a Taylor series where \\(a=0\\).
- A Taylor/Maclaurin series is said to converge to its generating function if
  it is equal to it for all members of its domain.
- **Example** Let \\(f(x)=\frac{1}{1+x}\\) with the domain \\(-1<x<1\\),
  and guess a formula for
  \\(f^{(k)}(0)\\) by computing its first few terms. Then show that
  the Maclaurin series generated by \\(f\\) converges to \\(f\\).
- **Example** Let \\(g(x)=\frac{2}{x}\\) with the domain \\(0<x<4\\),
  and guess a formula for
  \\(g^{(k)}(2)\\) by computing its first few terms. Then show that
  the Taylor series generated by \\(g\\) at \\(2\\) converges to \\(g\\).
- It can be shown that \\(f\\) defined by \\(f(0)=0\\) and
  \\(f(x)=e^{-1/x^2}\\) otherwise
  satisfies \\(f^{(k)}(0)=0\\), giving an example
  of a function which doesn't converge to its Taylor series.

### 6.2.2 Maclaurin Series for \\(e^x\\), \\(\\sin x\\), \\(\\cos x\\)

- The following Maclaurin Series can be shown to converge to their
  generating functions:
    - \\(e^x=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{x^k}{k!}
      = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{6}+\dots\\)
    - \\(\cos x = \sum_{k=0}^\infty(-1)^k\frac{x^{2k}}{(2k)!}
      = 1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}-\frac{x^6}{720}+\dots\\)
    - \\(\sin x = \sum_{k=0}^\infty(-1)^k\frac{x^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}
      = x-\frac{x^3}{6}+\frac{x^5}{120}-\frac{x^7}{5040}+\dots\\)
- **Example** Show how to generate the Maclaurin series for \\(e^x\\).
- **Example** Show how to generate the Maclaurin series for \\(\sin x\\).
