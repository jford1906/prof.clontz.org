## 3.3 The Washer Method

### 3.3.1 Rotation about Horizontal Axes

- Many solids may be described as revolutions of two-dimensional regions.
  Such solids have washer-shaped cross-sections.
- To obtain the volume of a solid of revolution about a horizontal axis,
  identify the outer radius \\(R(x)\\) and inner radius \\(r(x)\\) for each
  \\(x\\)-value, the leftmost \\(a\\) and rightmost \\(b\\) \\(x\\)-values
  in the region and use the formula
  \\(V=\int_a^b \pi([R(x)]^2-[r(x)]^2)\,dx\\).
- **Example**
  Find the volume of the solid of revolution obtained by rotating the
  triangle with vertices \\((0,0)\\), \\((2,2)\\), \\((2,4)\\) around
  the \\(x\\)-axis.
- **Example**
  Find the volume of the solid of revolution obtained by rotating the
  region bounded by \\(y=x\\) and \\(y=x^2\\) around the axis \\(y=2\\).

### 3.3.2 Rotation about Vertical Axes

- When the axis of revolution is vertical, simply use functions of \\(y\\)
  rather than \\(x\\), and the bottommost \\(c\\) and topmost \\(d\\)
  \\(y\\)-values:
  \\(V=\int_c^d \pi([R(y)]^2-[r(y)]^2)\,dy\\).
- **Example**
  Find the volume of the solid of revolution obtained by rotating the
  region bounded by \\(y=0\\), \\(x=1\\), \\(y=\sqrt{x}\\) around the
  axis \\(x=-1\\).
