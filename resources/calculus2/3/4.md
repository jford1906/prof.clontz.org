- As an alternative to the washer method, one may consider
  "cylindrical shell" cross-sections instead.
- The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by \\(2\pi rh\\).
- For a vertical axis of revolution, identify the radius \\(r(x)\\) and
  height \\(h(x)\\) of a cylindrical shell, identify the leftmost \\(a\\) and
  rightmost \\(b\\) \\(x\\)-values of the region, and use the formula
  \\(V=\int_a^b 2\pi r(x)h(x)\,dx\\).
- **Example**
  Find the volume of the solid of revolution obtained by rotating the
  region bounded by \\(y=0\\), \\(x=1\\), \\(y=\sqrt{x}\\) around the
  line \\(x=-1\\).

- **Example**
  Find the volume of the solid of revolution obtained by rotating the
  region bounded by \\(y=0\\), \\(x=\pm1\\), \\(y=x^2+1\\) around the
  line \\(x=2\\).

### 3.4.2 Rotation about Horizontal Axes

- When the axis of revolution is horiztonal, simply use functions of \\(y\\)
  rather than \\(x\\), and the bottommost \\(c\\) and topmost \\(d\\)
  \\(y\\)-values:
  \\(V=\int_c^d 2\pi r(y)h(y)\,dy\\).
- **Example**
  Find the volume of the solid of revolution obtained by rotating the
  triangle with vertices \\((-1,2)\\), \\((0,1)\\), \\((2,2)\\) around
  the \\(x\\)-axis.
