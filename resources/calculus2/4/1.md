## 4.1 Planar Parametrizations

### 4.1.1 Parametric Equations

- If \\(x(t),y(t)\\) are both defined as functions of \\(t\\) over some
  interval \\(I\\) of real numbers, then the set of points
  \\(\\{(x(t),y(t)):t\in I\\}\\) is the parametric curve with a
  system of parametric equations \\(x(t),y(t)\\). If \\(I\\) is omitted,
  then it is assumed that \\(t\\) belongs to subset of the interval
  \\((-\infty,\infty)\\) where both \\(x(t),y(t)\\) are well-defined.
- **Example**
  Plot the parametric curve \\(x=\cos t,y=\sin t\\) for
  \\(0\leq t\leq 2\pi\\), first by using a chart of \\(t,x,y\\) values,
  then by expressing the curve as an equation of \\(x,y\\).
- **Example**
  Show that the systems of parametric equations \\(x_0=t,y_0=t^2\\) and
  \\(x_1=2t-2,y_1=4t^2-8t+4\\) share the same parametric curve.

- The curve \\(y=f(x)\\) where \\(x\\) belongs to the interval \\(I\\)
  may be easily parametrized left-to-right
  by the system of parametric equations
  \\(x=t,y=f(t)\\) where \\(t\\) also belongs to \\(I\\).
- **Example**
  Give a system of parametric equations for the curve \\(y=\ln x\\)
  from \\((1,0)\\) to \\((e^2,2)\\).

### 4.1.3 Parametrizing Line Segments and Circles

- The line segment joining the points \\((x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1)\\) may
  be parametrized by \\(x=x_0+(x_1-x_0)t,y=y_0+(y_1-y_0)t\\) where
  \\(0\leq t\leq 1\\).
- **Example**
  Give a system of parametric equations for the line segment joining
  \\((2,-3)\\) and \\((-1,4)\\).
- **Example**
  Give two different systems of parametric equations for the portion of the
  line \\(y=3x-2\\) between \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=2\\).
- The full line may be obtained with the same equations
  by allowing \\(t\\) to range over all real numbers.

- The circle with center \\((x_0,y_0)\\) and radius \\(r\\) may be
  parametrized counter-clockwise by \\(x=x_0+r\cos\theta,y=y_0+r\sin\theta\\)
  where \\(0\leq\theta\leq2\pi\\).
- **Example**
  Give a system of parametric equations for the circle
  \\(x^2+y^2=9\\).
- The circle with center \\((x_0,y_0)\\) and radius \\(r\\) may be
  parametrized clockwise by \\(x=x_0+r\sin\theta,y=y_0+r\cos\theta\\)
  where \\(0\leq\theta\leq2\pi\\).
- **Example**
  Give a system of parametric equations for the circle
  \\((x-3)^2+(y+4)^2=25\\) beginning at \\((3,1)\\) and moving clockwise.
